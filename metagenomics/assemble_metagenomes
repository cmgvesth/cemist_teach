#Download the 2 metagenomes (4 fastq files) with wget

#how many lines are there in each?

#clean all 4 sequences
#hint: fastp can be installed with conda
#      fastp can meaningfully deal with paired end reads
#      https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp

#what did fastp actually clean?

#Assemble the two metagenomes one at a time
#hint: spades can be installed with conda
#      there are multiple ways to call spades, you are looking for metaspades.py
#      remember you have paired end reads
#      http://cab.spbu.ru/files/release3.12.0/manual.html

#sit back and wait

#Optional: Evaluate assembly with QUAST
#Quast takes a strange amount of spades, and probably wont help a lot in our dataset
