A small report on 2 graphs, each made with 2 seperate datasets

(code to donwload the contigs are in contig_downloads and both centrifuge outputs are in the folder)

For each graph, a couple of lines on the packages (and the options you ran them with) and some general conclusions on the graphs.

The graphs are on the 
  1) abundance of the resistance genes
  2) krona-representations of the phylogenies
  
  
In general, the idea is to write it so you understand what you did in two weeks
