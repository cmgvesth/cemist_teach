Download a database of antibiotic resistance genes
  wget https://card.mcmaster.ca/download/0/broadstreet-v3.0.0.tar.gz
  *You may have to unzip it through the graphical interface, right click and extract here

Install diamond like you have done the other times

Make a database out of the file 'protein_fasta_protein_homolog_model.fasta'
  diamond makedb --in protein_fasta_protein_homolog_model.fasta -d protein_homolog
  *makes a database out of the file and names it protein_homolog
  
Use diamond on the contigs you made (you need to fill in things in <> ) 
  diamond blastx -d <database> -q <your_contigs>  > <your_output_file>

Use head to inspect
The output is divided into columns of the following (described here http://www.metagenomics.wiki/tools/blast/blastn-output-format-6):
  qseqid sseqid pident length mismatch gapopen qstart qend sstart send evalue bitscore

What identities are we getting? Should we accept all of them? How about lengths? Can diamond be tweaked to change this?

Run the following script on the output file:
  awk '{a[$2]++;} END{for(i in a) print a[i]"  "i}' your_output_file 

What do you think it does?
