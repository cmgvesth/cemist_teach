Install centrifuge

Download centrifuge taxonomy
  wget ftp://ftp.ccb.jhu.edu/pub/infphilo/centrifuge/data/p_compressed+h+v.tar.gz

when you extract this, it will turn into 3 files which centrifuge considers a database of the name 'p_compressed+h+v'

Classify metagenome with centrifuge
  centrifuge -x <database> -1 <forward_read> -2 <reverse_read> -S <classified reads>

This will spit out a file of classificiation of each read as well as a more readable report, 'centrifuge_report.tsv'

Which species is most abundant? How many percent of the reads are classified?
Hint: how many reads are there in total? How many reads are classified?

Install krona

Krona has a couple of install errors in it for some reason, so we need to run this
# we delete a symbolic link that is not correct
rm -rf ~/miniconda3/envs/bioinf/opt/krona/taxonomy

# we create a directory in our home where the krona database will live
mkdir -p ~/krona/taxonomy

# now we make a symbolic link to that directory
ln -s ~/krona/taxonomy ~/miniconda3/envs/bioinf/opt/krona/taxonomy

Krona wants a file with the first and third column of the file with the classified reads, so run this
cat classified_reads | cut -f 1,3 > classified_reads.krona

then the krona program on that file
ktImportTaxonomy classified_reads.krona -o classified_reads_krona.html

Did that work? What does the program suggest you do? (note that the suggested command needs a kt in front of it (just 
like ktImportTaxonomy; the authors should really clean this program up). Remember that you changed the position of the database just 
before, so ask the program how it would like to know where to put stuff with the -h option

Now you can open the resulting html file in firefox!
